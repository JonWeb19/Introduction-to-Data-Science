There are several good platforms for doing these tasks, and in this tutorial we'll be using the Python programming language for almost all of them.\n",

You could download the libraries for these tools one-by-one, but there are a number of dependencies that make this process a little bit tedious. Instead, I recommend downloading the Anaconda distribution of Python provided by Continuum Analytics [link]. It comes with almost all of the libraries you'll ever need *and* it takes care of all of the dependency issues that would otherwise make you hate your life.\n",
