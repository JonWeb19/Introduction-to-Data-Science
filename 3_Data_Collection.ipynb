      "===\n",
      "Up until now, the data that you've been working with has been given to in the form of a text file, a database, or in a python pickle. In this module, we'll learn a few techniques for writing our own python scripts for collecting data from the internet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Collecting data from the internet can be done in one of two ways:\n",
      "1. through an API (Application Program Interface)\n",
      "2. by parsing html\n",
      "\n",
      "The API route is always preferable as it is (usually) sactioned by whomever is hosting the data, which allows them to dictate terms of use and monitor and restrict how their service is used. An access token (or \"key\") is typically required to access data from an official API.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all websites provide a public API for accessing data. In those cases, you may have to write a custom HTML parser. HTML is the language that the static components of webpages are written in. This code is usually well structured and it is often times not difficult to write a short script to find the elements of a interest in the HTML.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting Data via an API\n",
      "---\n",
      "Each API is different as is the process getting an API key. Usually getting an API key is as simple as creating an account and registering for a key. Almost all companies that offer a public API, also offer documentation on how to use their API and how to get a key. Here's Instagram's Developer's page: https://instagram.com/developer/\n",
      "\n",
      "Go ahead and go there and register a new client.  \n",
      "\n",
      ">**Note:** Most developers have their own web application and are using the Instagram API to allow the users of their web app to integrate their instagram data with their app. The client ID and client secret are specific to the web application and the access token is specific to the user of the web application. You can think of the access token as a custom username and password that the client can use on behalf of its users to get access to certain data that is only available to a user logged into Instagram. Something similar happens everytime you use facebook or google to \"login\" to a third party site. The third party side gets an access token from facebook or google and can use that to get your name, birthdate, gender or any other information that you've agreed to give it access to.\n",
      "Although we won't be making any requests on anybody elses behalf, we'll still need an access token to access Instagram data as though we were logged in.\n",
      "\n",
      "When filling out the form to register your client. You can use a personal webpage or any publicly available webpage for the \"Website URL\" and \"Redirect URI\". Before clicking the \"Register\" button, click the \"Security\" tab and uncheck the box that says \"Disable implicit OAuth\".  After you've registered write down your Client Id. Now click on the \"Autentecation\" tab on the left and follow the \"Client-Side (Implicit) Authentication\" directions to get an access token.\n",
      "\n",
      ">**Note:** Where the directions say \"Direct your user to our authorization URL\" you can copy and paste that url in your browser. Make sure you replace \"CLIENT-ID\" with your client id and \"REDIRECT-URI\" with whatever redirect url you chose when registering your client. When you click the \"authorize\" button, you'll get redirected to your \"Redirect URI\", but the url will include something like \"#access_token=703990239.f1d54a3.8cf94c42373e43a2951bce01d7ac0bf1\".

      "Instagram's [recent media user endpoint](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/#get_users_media_recent) returns recent posts for a given user id. By default, it will return 20 of the most recent posts, but you can supply parameters to override some of the defaults. For instance, if you wanted the last 20 posts from 2014, you include the `max_timestamp` parameter in your request with value 1420070400.\n",
      "\n",
      ">**side note: what is a unix timestamp?**  A unix timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. While it's a pretty inconvenient way to represent time from the point-of-view of human readability, you'll often see it used in data storage because it's easier to use in calculations, takes up less space, and is faster to lookup than a datetime string. Python's `datetime` library has a few functions for converting to and from unix time. You can also do these conversion for unix timestamps stored in a dataframe with pandas. And, if you have a single unix timestamp that you're going to lookup just once, you can also do so manually [here](http://www.epochconverter.com).\n",

      ">**PRO-TIP:** There are browser extensions that make it much easier to view json in your browser (everything is well-formatted and you can collapse values). For those of you who use the chrome web browser, [here's the json formatting extentsion that I use](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en). You may have to restart your to start the extension.\n",

      "###Pagination\n",
      "An API request doesn't always return all availalbe data. For instance, by default you only get the 20 most recent posts from Instagram's recent media endpoint, but even using the `count` param you can only get a maximum of 33 posts per request. One solution to get data for all posts is to use the `max_id` param and pass it the lowest id of your current results and continue to do this (using a `while-loop`) until the API returns an empty data set. If you're lucky, the API results will include a paginiation link that you can follow to get the next page for you. Then to get all of the results you'd just continue to follow the pagination link until there were no more pagination links.\n",
